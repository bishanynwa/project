        The possibilities of the modern world are massive. Science and technology have helped the world in such magical ways unimaginable before they were a reality. But science is more beautiful when the needy ones are helped. The smiles that these outcomes can give us are what the most magical use of technology is. 

Food wastage in the world is enormous. Especially in events such as parties, wedding and others food are being regularly wasted. To solve the waste food problem as well as use the food that is being wasted, we have developed a web-based application that manages the leftover food. This application is based on using left over foods from parties and events in banquets, restaurant, and hotels so that people who cannot afford to eat get to eat. The beauty is the smiles we get as a result. This is not just a web-based application, this is also a way to aware and introduce people to find a solution to food wastage. When we link up with various banquets and events as well as different NGO’s, INGO’s or other social servers, we serve as a communication medium between them. 

The web-based application is built using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. This application will work when the left-over foods from parties and other events are registered in the application by the banquets, hotels, and others as well. Then our algorithm will aware the nearest possible INGO’s, NGO’s and other social servers until one accepts the food. Then the social agencies will distribute food to orphans, street children and other needy people. The program will have two entry portals initially for the food distributors and the Social Organization. Using this the Hotels, Banquets, Social Organization can register themselves in the organization. Then they will be addressed to their different window. 

Finally, when the project is completed, it will be a wonderful medium that helps both socially and environmentally. On the same time waste foods are being saved as well as the needy ones are getting it. Looking at the smiles we get after the completion of this project will be magical and worth every single time, we spend to create this platform. It is a known fact that 1 in every 7 children die due to starvation in the world. Even if this platform starts locally the potential rises from local help to being used worldwide after some improvements are carried with in the web-based application.
